*************************** the parts of the assignment you have documented **********************
* I finished the documentation after my team started it. I also commented the HTML               *  
*************************** the parts of the assignment your team has documented ***************** 
* We documented the entire project.                                                              *
*************************** any extra part added to the documentation ****************************
* No extra documentation was added.                                                              *
********* any suggestions/enhancements you may have to improve the documentation process *********
* No extra enhancements were added, or really needed.                                            *
* The code is fairly self explainatory with correct variables and the like.                      *
